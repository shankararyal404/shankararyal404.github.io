reflection: |
  This is the English translation of the Nepali poem "अन्धकारको यात्री" (Traveler of Darkness), composed on a contemplative night on November 19, 2024, by Shankar Aryal. It explores the profound journey of life through the metaphor of traveling through darkness, seeking light, love, and self-understanding.
  
  The poem delves into the universal human experience of searching for meaning, connection, and enlightenment. The "darkness" represents not just the absence of light, but the unknown paths we traverse in our quest for truth and fulfillment.
  
  Through this piece, I aimed to capture the essence of spiritual awakening and the transformative power of love and self-discovery. It invites readers to reflect on their own journeys through life's uncertainties and the light they seek within themselves.
  
  **Note**: The original Nepali version of this poem is available as a separate post.

## Traveler of Darkness

As a traveler of darkness,  
I walk alone,  
Searching for light,  
Life's meaning and love.

In the depths of night,  
Stars twinkle bright,  
In the sky of my mind,  
Dreams take flight.

In search of love,  
I've lost myself,  
But darkness taught me,  
The path of self-discovery.

With every step,  
Learning new lessons,  
On life's journey,  
I move forward.

Darkness is my companion,  
Light is my goal,  
This journey is eternal,  
And I, a perpetual traveler.

With rays of love,  
My heart illuminates,  
On the path of self-knowledge,  
I progress continuously.

As a traveler of darkness,  
I find myself,  
Life's truth and love,  
This is my destination.

*-Shankar Aryal*
