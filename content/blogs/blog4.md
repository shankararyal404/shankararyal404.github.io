theme: "Women's struggles, societal judgment, trauma, and the silent burdens carried by women in society"
reflection: |
  This Villanelle formatted poem, "काग" (The Crow), was crafted during a mid night on Oct 23, 2023, by Shankar Aryal which consists of 19 lines with five tercets followed by a quatrain. The rhyme scheme is ABA for the tercets and ABAA for the quatrain. This form is known for its repetitive nature and emotional intensity. It explores the complex realities faced by women in society, delving into themes of societal perception, trauma, and loss.
  
  The crow symbolizes the burdens women carry, reflecting their pain and emotional turmoil caused by societal judgment and violence. References to the death of a husband evoke grief and vulnerability, while the mention of rape highlights the urgent need for awareness and change regarding women's safety.
  
  Through this piece, I aimed to shed light on the silent struggles women endure and to emphasize their resilience. The crow serves as a reminder of the potential for transformation and the importance of empathy towards women's experiences.

## काग्

रुदै भागेकी चाँदनीको चिरिएको गीत,  
पुछिएको सिऊदोको टुट्दो व्रत,  
अस्ताउँदो क्षितिजमा कागको प्रलय दृष्टि।

आकाशले उघार्यो रातको वीर्य,  
शिखामा बलिरहेछ दाहको राग,  
रुदै भागेकी चाँदनीको चिरिएको गीत।

भैरवको नृत्यमा झल्किँदैछ रक्तसारी,  
छायाँमा सूर्यको अभिशप्त यज्ञ,  
अस्ताउँदो क्षितिजमा कागको प्रलय दृष्टि।

गुलाबी फुल्को वेदनामा मुस्कान झरे,  
नवजात कोपिलाले आँसु पिए,  
रुदै भागेकी चाँदनीको चिरिएको गीत।

सिनामा उर्लिरहेछ अनन्तको नृत्य,  
रातको कालो कवचमा समय खसी रह्यो,  
अस्ताउँदो क्षितिजमा कागको प्रलय दृष्टि,  
रुदै भागेकी चाँदनीको चिरिएको गीत।
